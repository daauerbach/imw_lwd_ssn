This repo bundles several exploratory analyses of large wood measures collected by WDFW staff under the auspices of the Intensively Monitored Watersheds habitat monitoring program, led by Dr. Kirk Krueger and supported by WA SRFB. 

This work is presented for transparency and tracking, but it has not yet undergone technical peer review nor policy review; as such, it constitutes an incomplete draft of a scientific evaluation conducted by Dr. Daniel Auerbach and does not necessarily represent agency or collaborator views.
